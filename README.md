## Requirements
* Python 3

## Overview

You've been given a dataset in quoted CSV format with a series of connected vehicle data points. 

You've been given some existing code in which you'll produce a clean output of the dataset.

**To do this you'll need to implement the `parse_row` method in `csvparser.py`, and this should be your only focus.**
  
CSV:
```
"VehicleD","Driver Side Window","Down"
"VehicleU","Front Wipers","On"
"VehicleX","Fuel Level","70%"
...
```

Console output:
```
VehicleD - Driver Side Window - Down 
VehicleU - Front Wipers - On
VehicleX - Fuel Level - 70% 
...
```

## Getting Started

Create a new virtual environment:

```sh
# Windows
$ py -m venv venv

# MacOS/Unix
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
# Windows
$ source venv/Scripts/activate

# MacOS/Unix
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Run the app:

```sh
# Windows
$ py app.py

# MacOS/Unix
$ python3 app.py
```
